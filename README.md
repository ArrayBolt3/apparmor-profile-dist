# AppArmor Profile for Anonymity Linux Distributions #

Displaces /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/base with a version, that includes
additions required for Anonymity Linux Distributions.

Does not depend on AppArmor, so this package can be installed by default on
any anonymity distribution by default, without requiring to also have AppArmor
installed. Just for the case, AppArmor gets installed later by the user.
