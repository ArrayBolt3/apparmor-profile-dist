Description: AppArmor Profile for Anonymity Linux Distributions
 Displaces /etc/apparmor.d/abstractions/base with a version, that includes
 additions required for Anonymity Linux Distributions.
 .
 Does not depend on AppArmor, so this package can be installed by default on
 any anonymity distribution by default, without requiring to also have AppArmor
 installed. Just for the case, AppArmor gets installed later by the user.
